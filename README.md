# what is html element and how it works ?
- An HTML element is a fundamental part of HTML, which consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. HTML elements are used to structure content on a webpage and tell the browser how to display that content.
- Start Tag: Indicates the beginning of an element.
- Content: The content inside the element.
- End Tag: Indicates the end of an element.
- How It Works
- Start Tag: The browser recognizes the start tag and starts applying the defined behavior for that element.
- Content: The browser processes the content, which can be text, other HTML elements, or media (like images).
- End Tag: The browser recognizes the end tag, which tells it to stop applying the - defined behavior and close the element.

Attribute Value: The value assigned to the attribute, usually enclosed in quotes.

class: Specifies one or more class names for an element.
style: Specifies an inline CSS style for an element.

src (for <img>): Specifies the URL of the image.
alt (for <img>): Provides alternative text for the image.
type (for <input>): Specifies the type of input control (e.g., text, radio, checkbox).
value (for <input>): Specifies the initial value of the input control.
